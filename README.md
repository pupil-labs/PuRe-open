# PuRe Open

Open source implementation of the pupil detection algorithm described in the paper ["PuRe: Robust pupil detection for real-time pervasive eye tracking"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314218300146).

**Disclaimer**: This implementation was created for evaluation purposes only and is not longer maintained by Pupil Labs. We recommend having a look at [@tcsantini's official Python implementation](https://github.com/tcsantini/eyerec-python) instead.
